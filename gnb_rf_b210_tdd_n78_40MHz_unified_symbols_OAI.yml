# This example configuration outlines how to configure the srsRAN Project gNB to create a single TDD cell
# transmitting in band 78, with 40 MHz bandwidth and 30 kHz sub-carrier-spacing. A USRP B210 is configured 
# as the RF frontend using split 8, with an Octoclock as an external reference clock.
